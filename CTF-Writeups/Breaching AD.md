## **1. Introduction**

This CTF walkthrough demonstrates various authentication-based attacks in an Active Directory environment, highlighting weaknesses in **NTLM authentication, password spraying, LDAP pass-back attacks, and credential extraction from PXE boot images and databases**.

The simulated environment consists of:
- **Domain Controller** (`THMDC - 10.200.80.101`)
- **Web Server** (`THM IIS - 10.200.80.201`)
- **PXE Boot Server** (`THM MDT - 10.200.80.202`)
- **Attacking System** (Kali/Linux machine)

### **Objectives**
‚úÖ Enumerate NTLM authentication mechanisms  
‚úÖ Exploit weak credentials via password spraying  
‚úÖ Capture NTLM authentication hashes via LDAP attacks  
‚úÖ Extract stored credentials from PXE boot images  
‚úÖ Analyze sensitive credentials in the McAfee database

## **2. Reconnaissance & Initial Access**

The first step was verifying if the **targeted domain name resolution** was correctly set. We configured our DNS settings to use the domain controller (`10.200.80.101`).

Once configured, an **nslookup query** was performed to validate DNS resolution.

We then checked for previously compromised credentials using the public breach-checking site:

**Q1: What popular website can be used to verify if your email address or password has ever been exposed in a publicly disclosed data breach?**
üìù **Answer:** `haveibeenpwned`

---

## **3. Password Spraying Attack**

To identify weak credentials, we attempted a **password spraying attack** against NTLM authentication.

**Q2: What is the name of the challenge-response authentication mechanism that uses NTLM?**
üìù **Answer:** `netntlm`

Using an **NTLM password spraying script**, we tested a default password (`Changeme123`) against a list of known usernames.

The attack was **successful**, revealing **four valid credential pairs**:
- **Third Valid Username:** `gordon.stevens`
- **Total Valid Credentials Found:** `4`

Testing one of the compromised accounts on the **NTLM-secured web application** displayed the following response:

**Q5: What is the message displayed by the web application when authenticating with a valid credential pair?**
üìù **Answer:** `Hello World`

## **4. LDAP Pass-Back Attack**

Next, we targeted **LDAP authentication vulnerabilities** by setting up a **rogue LDAP server** to capture plaintext credentials.

**Q6: What type of attack can be performed against LDAP Authentication systems not commonly found against Windows Authentication systems?**
üìù **Answer:** `ldap pass-back attack`

We allowed **`login` and `plain` authentication mechanisms** to force unencrypted logins.

Captured credentials:
- **Username:** `svcLDAP`
- **Password:** `tryhackmeldappass1@`

## **5. NTLM Authentication Poisoning**

To capture **NTLM authentication hashes**, we deployed **Responder**.

**Q9: What is the name of the tool we can use to poison and capture authentication requests on the network?**
üìù **Answer:** `responder`

**Screenshot:**  ![Responder Setup](screenshots//Screenshot_20250223_132043.png)  

Captured credentials:
- **Username:** `svcFileCopy`
- **Cracked Password:** `FPassword1!`

## **6. PXE Boot Image Credential Extraction**

Using **TFTP**, we retrieved PXE Boot configuration files to extract credentials.

**Q12: What Microsoft tool is used to create and host PXE Boot images in organisations?**
üìù **Answer:** `Microsoft Deployment Toolkit`

**Q13: What network protocol is used for recovery of files from the MDT server?**
üìù **Answer:** `TFTP`

Extracted credentials:
- **Username:** `svcMDT`
- **Password:** `PXEBootSecure1@`

## **7. McAfee Database Credential Extraction**

Extracting stored credentials from the McAfee **`ma.db`** database.

**Q18: What table in this database stores the credentials of the orchestrator?**
üìù **Answer:** `AGENT_REPOSITORIES`

Decrypted credentials using a python script ![Mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption](https://github.com/funoverip/mcafee-sitelist-pwd-decryption):
- **Username:** `svcAV`
- **Password:** `MyStrongPassword!`

## **8. Conclusion & Lessons Learned**

### **Key Findings:**
- Weak passwords enabled **password spraying attacks**.
- **LDAP authentication** was vulnerable to **pass-back attacks**, exposing plaintext credentials.
- **NTLM authentication poisoning** allowed **credential interception and cracking**.
- **PXE boot images stored domain admin-level credentials**.
- **McAfee database contained stored credentials**, which were easily decrypted.

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
‚úÖ Enforce strong passwords & eliminate default credentials  
‚úÖ Disable NTLM authentication where possible  
‚úÖ Enforce LDAP signing & channel binding  
‚úÖ Restrict access to PXE boot files and encrypt stored credentials  
‚úÖ Secure McAfee configurations by hashing and salting stored passwords  

üöÄ **Stay secure, and keep hacking!**
