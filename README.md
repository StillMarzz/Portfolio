Cybersecurity Portfolio

About This Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on experience in security operations, SIEM analysis, threat detection, and incident response. The projects here reflect my practical learning from home labs, CTF challenges, and security research.

Sections

üè† Home Lab Projects

Splunk SIEM Setup ‚Äì Configured Splunk on an Ubuntu server to collect and analyze Windows event logs.

Incident Response Simulation ‚Äì Investigated simulated security incidents using Splunk and Windows Event Logs.

üîé Threat Hunting & Detection

Log Analysis ‚Äì Analyzed Windows Event Logs for security incidents.

Custom Splunk Queries ‚Äì Created detection rules for common attack techniques.

üéØ CTF & Practical Write-Ups

HTB & THM Challenges ‚Äì Detailed walkthroughs focusing on SOC-relevant skills.

SOC Analysis CTFs ‚Äì Investigated simulated attacks in CTF environments.

‚ö° Scripts & Automation

Log Parsing Scripts ‚Äì Python/Bash scripts for automating log analysis.

Alerting & Monitoring ‚Äì Automated scripts for detecting anomalies.

How to Use This Portfolio

Each section contains structured documentation of my work.

Write-ups include step-by-step explanations and screenshots.

Log analysis examples provide real-world security insights.
